        <h3>COVID-19</h3>

        <p>
            Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused
            by a new virus.
        </p>
        <p>
            The disease causes respiratory illness (like the flu) with
            symptoms such as a cough, fever, and in more severe cases,
            difficulty breathing. You can protect yourself by washing your
            hands frequently, avoiding touching your face, and avoiding
            close contact (1 meter or 3 feet) with people who are unwell.
        </p>

        <h5>How it spreads</h5>
        <p>
            Coronavirus disease spreads primarily through contact with an
            infected person when they cough or sneeze. It also spreads
            when a person touches a surface or object that has the virus
            on it, then touches their eyes, nose, or mouth.
